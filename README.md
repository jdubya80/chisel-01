### What is this?

Chisel is a GitHub challenge where every small action contributes to something greater.

Your task is simple: **Remove one file.**  
That’s it. No code, no complexity—just a tiny moment of progress.

Every file removed gets us closer to uncovering something.  
What will it be? You’ll have to help chisel away to find out.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork this repo.
2. Delete one file from the `files` directory.
3. Submit a pull request.
4. Watch as it’s automatically merged.

### Why This Exists

We all love the feeling of making progress—even in small ways.  
But sometimes, progress isn't about building—it’s about removing.

Chisel is an experiment in habit-building, teamwork, and simple wins.  
Every file removed gets us closer to revealing what’s underneath.

### Rules

- **You can only delete one file per pull request.**
- **No automation—each PR must be manual.**
- **No edits—only deletions.**
- **A maximum of 20 PRs per user per day is preferred.**
- **PRs that add or modify files will be rejected.**

### What Happens When It's Done?

Once all files are gone, we archive this challenge and start a new one.  
Each season will bring new challenges, mysteries, and milestones.

Can we chisel our way through 10,000 files? Let’s find out.
